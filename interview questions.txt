Common Git Production Patterns

Recovering Commits
```
Recover deleted commits
git reflog
git checkout <hash>

Recover from force push
git reflog
git reset --hard <hash>

Recover from hard reset
git reflog
git checkout <hash>
```

BFG for large repos (faster)
bfg --delete-files <file> <repo.git>

Force push to remove history
git push -f --all
git push -f --tags
```

 Syncing Branches
```
Sync feature branch with main
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

Or merge approach
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main

Fast-forward only merge
git merge --ff-only origin/main
```

Debugging Issues
```
Find which commit broke things
git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD
git bisect good <old-commit>

See what changed in a commit
git show <commit-hash>

See who changed a line
git blame <file>

 Find deleted lines
git log -p -S <text> <file>
```

THE PRODUCTION ISSUE QUESTION

How to Structure Your Answer:

Setup (30 seconds)
- What I changed
- What system it affected
- Why I thought it was safe

What Broke (30 seconds)
- What symptoms appeared
- Who/how many users affected
- What alerts/monitoring caught it
- How long until we noticed

How I Fixed It (1 minute)
- Immediate mitigation (rollback/disable)
- How long to restore service
- Workarounds during investigation
- What the root cause was

What I Learned (1 minute)
- Process that should have caught this
- What monitoring was missing
- What testing was insufficient
- How we changed procedures
- Metrics (MTTR before/after, availability impact)

Example Framework:
```
I deployed a config change that removed a critical resource tag.
This caused all Kubernetes pods to lose their IAM role permissions
and they started failing to write to S3. 

We noticed when CloudWatch alarms triggered on increased 4xx errors
from the app. I checked recent deployments and saw my change.

I rolled back immediately (5 min recovery) and deployed the fix
with proper tag validation in our config tests.

After this, we added tag validation in CI/CD pre-checks and
automated testing for IAM role assumptions. MTTR went from 15min
to 2min for similar issues.
```
