2 Service Not Accessible
   Pods are healthy, but the service endpoint isn’t reachable. How do you troubleshoot?

3 Pods Stuck in Pending
   You deployed pods, but they’re stuck in Pending state. What could be the reasons?

4 ConfigMap Changes Not Reflecting

6 Failed Deployment Rollout
   You applied a new deployment, but rollout fails. How would you investigate?

🟥 Linux Scenarios
1 Disk Space Full Suddenly
   A server’s disk got full overnight. How would you identify the cause and free up space?

2 High CPU Usage
   A process is using 100% CPU — how do you identify which process and why?

3 File Permission Issue
   A script fails with “Permission Denied”, but you’re root. What could be wrong?

4 Service Not Starting
   nginx or sshd service fails to start — how do you debug?

🟨 Terraform Scenarios
1 Terraform Apply Fails with “Already Exists”
   You’re trying to create an S3 bucket and Terraform throws “Bucket already exists”. How do you handle it?

2 State File Corruption
   Your remote S3 Terraform state file got corrupted. How do you recover?

3 Unexpected Resource Deletion in Plan
   Terraform shows a deletion plan for a resource that shouldn’t change. What do you check?

4 Drift Between Infra and State
   Infra is changed manually in AWS Console. How do you detect and fix drift?

5 Rollback After Bad Apply

6 Multiple Environments (Dev, Stage, Prod)
   How would you structure and manage Terraform state for multiple environments?

🟪 Jenkins Scenarios

2 Jenkins Pipeline Fails Midway
   Jenkins pipeline stops at one stage without clear error. How do you troubleshoot?

3 Credentials Missing
   A pipeline fails due to missing AWS or Docker credentials. How do you securely manage them?

4 Jenkins Slave/Agent Not Connecting
   Jenkins agent is offline and not connecting to master. What steps do you take?
